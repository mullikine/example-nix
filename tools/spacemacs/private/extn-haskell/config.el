  "Priority order of ways to try to run GHCi for ‘dante-mode’.

This improves upon setting ‘dante-methods-alist’ directly.

Allowed values include a set of symbols (described below) or custom function.

Provided functions should accept as a parameter the detected Haskell package's
root (see ‘dante-project-root’). The function should return the command line
invocation (as a list of strings) for a GHCi REPL for the package.

So you don't have to write as many functions, you can alternatively use symbols
as aliases for built-in functions.

The following symbols alias functions from the default setting of
‘dante-methods-alist’:

    ‘bare’: run cabal repl unconditionally

    ‘mafia’: run mafia if a \"mafia\" file is in the root

    ‘new-build’: run cabal new-repl if a \"*.cabal\" or a \"cabal.project\"
    file is in the root

    ‘nix’: run cabal repl in a nix-shell if a \"shell.nix\" or \"default.nix\"
    file is in the root

    ‘stack’: run stack repl if a \"stack.yaml\" file is in the root

    ‘styx’: run styx repl if a \"sytx.yaml\" file is in the root

There's a few shortages with the options above. Firstly, they invoke a GHCi
session without ignoring the user-level .ghci file, which can sometimes
conflict with project-level compilation. Also, because Cabal and Stack support
multiple packages, a \"cabal.project\" or \"stack.yaml\" file might not just be
in the package root, but in one of its ancestors.

The follow symbols alias additional built-in functions address these problem:

    ‘bare-new-guess’: like ‘bare’, but call cabal new-repl

    ‘cabal-new-guess’: run cabal new-repl if a \"cabal.project\" file is found in an
    ancestor of the root

    ‘nix-new-guess’: run cabal new-repl in a nix-shell if a \"shell.nix\" file is
    found in an ancestor of the root.

    ‘stack-guess’: run stack repl in a nix-shell if a \"stack.yaml\" file is
    found in an ancestor of the root.")


(defvar extn-haskell/dante-xref-enable t
  "Whether to enable ‘xref’ support for ‘dante-mode’.
